## Project Website

### Getting started
Blah blah blah

### Did you know..
Blah blah blah

As of right now, there are protected client & admin routes. Furthermore, each client can only see their own portfolio, whereas 
each admin can see all the portfolios.

### TODOs

#### fix templating layouts
  > it is really ugly right now and growing bigger, it will be a mess.
#### figure out how admins can edit a client's portfolio
  > once this is achieved, another milestone (albeit small) will be achieved
    this is one of the core functionalities the website should provide
#### modify the implemented login + email system with the website to be more fluent
  > it sucks having to login & logout through /home
  > it sucks when you reset your password (on user create)
    just doesn't feel well
#### throw it up on the server
  > this is gonna suck so it has been delayed, but it's pretty important
#### logout a user after a certain amount of time
